# Instructions
Please fill out the `fizzbuzz` script solution. 

## Questions

FizzBuzz. Write a bash command that takes in an input of a number and runs the fizz buzz algorithm on it.
Fizz buzz is an algorithm that prints `fizz` if a number is divisible by 3, `buzz` if divisible by 5,
and `fizz buzz` if divisible by 3 and 5. If the output is none of these, print out nothing. DO NOT
use anything such as if or else statements, you should only use logical operators and check for
conditions such as `x % 5`. This should also be done in one line without using
any `if` or `else` statements. 

Examples
```
x=3
# run your fizz buzz command
> fizz
x=5
# run your fizz buzz command
> buzz
x=15
# run your fizz buzz command
> fizz buzz
x=2 
# run your fizz buzz command
>
```
Do not worry about being tested on edge cases like input of a string.

## Contest
Fill out the `contest` script with a cool bash script. This bash script must be original, aka not copied. The definition of original here is `if Josh can google it and find it then it is not original`, and remember, I am the best at googling. The winner will recieve a copy of `Cracking the Coding Interview`.
