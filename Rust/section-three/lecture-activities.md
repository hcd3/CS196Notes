# Matching with Enums
Fill out the code using the json parser	`serde` again to use a match statement
for locations. The goal is to print out all of the people who live in each
region. For this assignment, the only locations we are concerned with are
`BAY_AREA`, `NAPERVILLE`, and `NEW_JERSEY`. Here is an example output

```
josh $ cargo run data.json
BAY_AREA
Yash
Rishi
Clara
NAPERVILLE
Melissa
Jatin
Zach
NEW_JERSEY
Jackie
Alina
Vivek
```
