# Rust 1

Rust is a systems programming language, similar to C and C++. You can go to
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)) to read more on it. If you
have been reading the Rust book a bit, you should know what some of the syntax looks like and
whatnot. 

## How to basic - code in Rust

Read [Chapter 3](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html) of the
Rust book. The book describes things well and it is useless repeating information.
