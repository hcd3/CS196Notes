# Instructions

Fill out the `main.rs` file in the `capitalize-input` directory.

## Example
When running your program, your output should look something similar to this.
You should echo the input first and then print out the capitalized input.

```Bash
josh$ cargo run hello
You entered hello
HELLO
```

Your job is to fill out the function paramaters and the functions themselves.
Neither of the two helper functions return anything.
